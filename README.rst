=======

This is the implementation of https://github.com/apps/qeb-hwt.

Let Bots, powered with AI and continuously learning to increase its knowledge, manage your dependencies..

Installation
============

To install Qeb-HWt App, please refer to the following `link <https://github.com/thoth-station/Qeb-Hwt/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md>`__.

Usage
======

Qeb-Hwt is one of the integration of `Thamos CLI <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser/blob/master/docs/source/integration.rst>`__.
Internally, it relies on `Thamos CLI <https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos/>`__
and on actual `Thoth Adviser <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser/>`__, core component that provides reccomendations.

You need to provide your own custom configuration file as a template called `.thoth.yaml`.

An example of configuration file template can be:

.. code-block:: console

    host: {THOTH_SERVICE_HOST}
    tls_verify: true
    requirements_format: pipenv

    runtime_environments:
    - name: '{os_name}:{os_version}'
      operating_system:
        name: {os_name}
        version: '{os_version}'
      hardware:
        cpu_family: {cpu_family}
        cpu_model: {cpu_model}
      python_version: '{python_version}'
      cuda_version: {cuda_version}
      recommendation_type: stable

Listing of automatically expanded configuration options which are supplied the
config sub-command (these options are optional and will be expanded based on HW
or SW discovery):

+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| Configuration option   | Explanation                    | Example  |
+========================+================================+==========+
| `os_name`              | name of operating system       | fedora   |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| `os_version`           | version of operating system    |  30      |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| `cpu_family`           | CPU family identifier          |  6       |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| `cpu_model`            | CPU model identifier           |  94      |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| `python_version`       | Python version (major.minor)   |  3.6     |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+
| `cuda_version`         | CUDA version (major.minor)     |  9.0     |
+------------------------+--------------------------------+----------+

These configuration options are optional and can be mixed with adjustment based
on environment variables (see ``THOTH_SERVICE_HOST`` example above). Note the
environment variables are not expanded on `thamos config` call but rather on
other sub-commands issued (e.g. ``thamos advise`` or others).

The output format coming out of recommendations can be compatible with
`Pipenv <https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/>`__,
`raw pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/>`__  or similar to the one
provided by `pip-tools <https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/>`__ (actually same as for
``pip`` as these formats are interchangeable). The format is configured using
``requirements_format`` configuration option, available options are:

* ``requirements_format: pipenv`` for `Pipenv <https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/>`__ compatible output.

Remember you need to have ``Pipfile`` in your directory in this case.

* ``requirements_format: pip`` or ``requirements_format: pip-tools`` for `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/>`__ or `pip-tools <https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/>`__ compatible output.

Remember you need to have ``requirements.txt`` or ``requirements.in`` in your directory in this case.

An example of configuration:

.. code-block:: console

    host: khemenu.thoth-station.ninja
    tls_verify: false
    requirements_format: pipenv

    runtime_environments:
    - name: rhel:8
      operating_system:
        name: rhel
        version: "8"
      python_version: "3.6"
      recommendation_type: latest

Support for multiple runtime environments
=========================================

Thoth performs recommendations based on your hardware and software environment,
so called runtime environments. You can specify more than just one runtime
environment that should be targetted during recommendations as stated `here <https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos#support-for-multiple-runtime-environments>`__.

Currently Qeb-Hwt Thoth Integration will take the first runtime environment entry stated in the ``runtime_environments`` listing by default.
